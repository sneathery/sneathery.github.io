<p>Stacey worked in technology for over 10 years, holding roles such as Program Manager, Project Manager, and Analyst.  The field of technology was an intentional choice for her, one that would draw her closer to her love of problem solving and programming.  Through all the years, Stacey's career always held her in positions of overseeing development but not actually knowing how to develop.  Through Flatiron, Stacey plans to change this and move her career into that of a developer and eventual Tech Lead.</p>
