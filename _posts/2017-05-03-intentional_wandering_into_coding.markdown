# Where it all began

Back in middle school, I was selected to pursue an advanced math program that had me taking math classes for college credit in 9th grade.  By the time I became a senior in high school, they were out of math classes to teach us.  I loved math. I loved math because it involved problem solving.

I went off to college thinking I would pursue math, but as I got into the program I started to fall out of love, and to be honest, I got a little scared.  Math in college was hard, and math had never been hard for me.  

I started to think about my other interests.  I had loved building websites in HTML back in high school. Now keep in mind, back in my high school years there were no coding classes.  Heck, very few students even had a laptop.  But I had a friend who did and every day after school I would sit at his computer for hours building and changing my websites. 

I thought about how my love of problem solving was fulfilled with the constant tinkering of my websites.  I decided to take some CS classes and see if that might be a better fit.

# Letting others influence my dreams

I'll cut to the chase -- I did not pursue a CS degree (obvi - I'm now in a coding bootcamp!).  

In one of my first CS classes a professor called me out for being the only girl in class and made me feel like an outsider and that I did not belong.  I did not pursue a CS degree becuase I let some sexist remarks influence me and question my own ability.

I beat myself a lot about letting someone influence me in this way, but the honest truth is that no professor (scratch that -- no HUMAN) should ever belittle or make someone feel incapable becuase of their race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, eye color, eating habits, accent, pet's name -- you get the point.

# Straight paths were never my thing 
Very soon after college I realized I still wanted to spend my days solving problems, and specifically with computers.  I began volunteering after work with my IT department, setting up new computer workstations.  I thought maybe my interest was just in computers, so I pursued the CompTIA A+ certification in computer hardware.  

That did not end up fulfilling me, so I again, returned to my roots and thought about what I enjoyed and I kept comping back to the joy of building my own websites when I was in highschool. 

I began to analyze my transferable skills and spent the next 3 years weaving my career into a Project Management role within the software development industry. And this is where I have spent my professional hours for the last 8 years - weaving and growing through Project Management into Program Management, and dabbling in PMO management and Client Management. (There have been some crazy offshoots as well. Let's get online coffee & trade stories.) For the most part, I have been happy these 8 years. 

But as with my love of problem solving, I love being challenged and the role is not as challenging anymore and the next ring on the ladder does not excite me.  Looking back over the last 8 years, I have been happiest when I am working directly with developers and translating client's root needs into technical implementations. 

I want to get my hands dirty in the actual building of websites and applications.  **Maybe in ~5 years I will be in a place where I can combine my Project Management + Client Management + Developer skills and be a kickass Technical Lead for some amazing small to mid-size company that has a double bottom line.**  

# The start of the uprising
Over the past 10 years I have spent my volunteer time working with women's powerment organizations.  My goal after I finish bootcamp is to find ways to encourage more women to get into (and stay in) Tech.  I want to ensure those with a dream do not put theirs on hold the way that I did.  And if I do find others who have put their dreams on hold, I want to be the springboard to getting them back on the path to realization.
